What is it?

PyOWM is a client Python wrapper library for OpenWeatherMap (OWM) web APIs. It allows quick and easy consumption of OWM data from Python applications via a simple object model and in a human-friendly fashion.

API key

As OpenWeatherMap APIs need a valid API key to allow responses, PyOWM won't work if you don't provide one. This stands for both free and paid (pro) subscription plans. You can signup for a free API key on the OWM website https://openweathermap.org/api


If you fork this project make sure to change API key.
